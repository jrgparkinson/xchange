<h2>Overview</h2>
This is a trading game based on the cross country (XC) season. The primary quantities which can be traded are shares in athletes, 
which have value because dividends are paid to the owners of these shares after each race, the size of which is dependent on how the 
athlete performs and the predetermined importance of the event. Athletes who finish higher will result in a higher dividend, 
and therefore are worth more. 

In addition to trading shares in athletes, it will also be possible (currently work in progress) to trade financial derivatives 
based on these shares such as futures, options, and swaps.

The aim of the game is to increase the value of your portfolio by clever trading with other players. At the end of the game, 
the player with the most valuable portfolio wins.
<h2>Start of the game</h2>
At the start of the game, every player starts with Â£1000 and the bank owns 100 shares in each athlete. Before trading starts, 
there will be a blind auction where every player can place bids for an ammount of shares in each athlete. The highest bid will win,
as long as the player has sufficient funds to pay the bank, with bids being processed in order from the 
greatest bid (per share) down to the smallest.

Unsold shares will be available to purchase at a later date, either through another auction or buying directly from the bank for the
current trading price of the athlete.
<h2>Trading</h2>
Any investor can trade with any other investor. A trade starts with an investor initiating a trade, by asking to buy or offering to sell
some asset (typically some a share for some volume of an athlete) for some price.
